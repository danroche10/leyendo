Production version: leyendo-v2.herokuapp.com

Some notes on the project:

- This is a MERN stack application that enables users to find their favourite essays through searching by topic and author. Users are then able to comment their thoughts on each essay and interact with other users.

- The app is fully responsive on mobile.

- The database is on MongoDB Atlas. I used Postman to test the endpoints and used Robo3T to play around with the database.

- The API is built from scratch.

- I used useContext to manage states as I didn't see the need to use Redux!

- This is the first version of the app. I am currently working on a second version which will incorporate technologies such as GraphQL and will provide more depth to the user experience.
